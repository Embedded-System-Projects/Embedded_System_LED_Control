                     # Steps for successful simulation

=> Step 1: open PIC24F04KA200-SPST-LEDs proteus project
=> Step 2: double click on the PIC24F04KA200 Microcontroller, 
           go to the program file row and click the folder icon
=> Step 3: find and click on PIC24F04KA200_SPST_LEDs.production.hex inside the hex file folder
=> Step 4: Finally its done! you may now run the simulation!

                     # Project description

=> This project is done using the following softwares
      * Proteus (Version 8.10)
      * MPLAB X IDE and XC8 compiler (For generating the hex file)
